# AVAYL Coding Challenge â€“ Text Chunking App

Thank you Alex and Rida for the invitation to participate in this challenge. I enjoyed working on this and would love to continue contributing.


## Current Progress

- Fully working frontend and backend integration
- Users can input text, adjust page height, and view chunked output
- The app uses a clean component-based structure with composables for logic separation

Thanks again for the opportunity.

## Setup

### Backend

```
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run
```


### Frontend

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Create a `.env` file inside the frontend folder and set the backend API URL:

```
VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```
